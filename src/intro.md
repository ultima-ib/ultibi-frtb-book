# Introduction

**[ultima](https://ultimabi.uk/)** is a tool which allows you to define, compute and breakdown the key performance metrics of your business.

This user guide is a walk through of **[ultima](https://ultimabi.uk/)** applied to a very particular case - **[Fundamental Review of the Trading Book's Standardised Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_Review_of_the_Trading_Book)**. For a more general usecase refer to the general user guide. Here we will focus on FRTB only.

The calculation goes as per **[FRTB SA Paper](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d457.pdf)** and aims to be fully compliant(although not yet certified). **[ultima](https://ultimabi.uk/)** also supports **[CRR2](https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/single-rulebook/interactive-single-rulebook/108255)** parameter set as switch between the two is as easy as setting `jurisdiction` to `CRR2` or `BCBS`.
