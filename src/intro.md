# Introduction

**[Ultima](https://ultimabi.uk/)** is a tool which allows you to define, compute and breakdown the key performance metrics of your business.

This user guide is a walk through of **[Ultima](https://ultimabi.uk/)** applied to a very particular case - **[FRTB SA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_Review_of_the_Trading_Book)**. For a more general usecase refer to the general user guide. Here we will focus on FRTB only.

The calculation goes as per **[FRTB SA Paper](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d457.pdf)** (SA for Standardised Approach) and aims to be fully compliant. As prescribed by the regulator, this compute intensive calculation is applicable to every trading desk in the portfolio.
