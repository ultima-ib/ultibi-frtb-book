# FRTB SA - Input format
Any calculation/function needs inputs. In case of FRTB SA the **input is your portfolio sensitivities at trade level**. Currently expected format is like this: [Sensitivities.csv](https://ultima-bi.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/frtb/Delta.csv). This format is very similar to the industry standard [CRIF](https://www.isda.org/a/aBzTE/The-Future-of-Risk-Capital-and-Margin.pdf). Coming soon full CRIF support. 

Table below will outline which columns are expected.
